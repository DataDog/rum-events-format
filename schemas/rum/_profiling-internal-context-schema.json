Use the normal bundle to use the Profiler.\n- `initializing`: The Profiler is initializing (i.e., when the SDK just started). This is the initial status.\n- `missing-feature`: Missing `profiling` value in the `enableExperimentalFeatures` options.\n- `not-sampled`: The view was not sampled (i.e., when the sample rate is lower than 100%, there is a chance the view won't be profiled).\n- `not-supported-by-browser`: The browser does not support the Profiler (i.e., `window.Profiler` is not available).\n- `failed-to-lazy-load`: The Profiler script failed to be loaded by the browser (may be a connection issue or the chunk was not found).\n- `failed-to-start`: The Profiler failed to start (most probable cause is when the web server did not return the `Document-Policy: js-profiling` HTTP response header).\n- `running`: The Profiler is running.\n- `stopped`: The Profiler is stopped.",
